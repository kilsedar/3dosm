# 2017 GSoC project "OSM Extrusion Adapter"

The goal of this project is to create an adapter to display OpenStreetMap (OSM) data on NASA Web World Wind. The OSM data is going to be fetched in real time based on the bounding box or URL for OSM data and keywords provided. The adapter will offer a function to extrude the polygons. Additionally the project may extract the real heights of buildings using DSM data, improve performance via various caching techniques, and tile the data. In case the tiling will be implemented, a new adapter may be created to tile GeoJSON data.
